## 📝 What is KritaToXDTS?

KritaToXDTS is a tool designed to help you export your animated paint layers from Krita as image sequences. Alongside the images, it saves timing data in the Toei Digital Exposure Sheet format (.xdts). This format works with popular software like Clip Studio Paint, OpenToonz, and more. It makes your animation workflow smoother when moving your work between different programs.

If you work on frame-by-frame animations or want a way to organize your animated layers with timing information, KritaToXDTS can help.

## 🖥 How to Use KritaToXDTS

1. Open Krita and load your animated file with paint layers.

2. Locate KritaToXDTS in the tools or plugin section from the menu. It may appear under "Scripts" or "Extensions."

3. Select the layers you want to export.

4. Choose the export settings:
    - Folder location to save image sequences.
    - Format (usually PNG for best quality).
    - Output file name pattern.

5. Click the "Export" or "Run" button.

6. KritaToXDTS will generate a sequence of images and a matching `.xdts` file with your animation’s timing details.

7. Open your preferred animation software (Clip Studio Paint, OpenToonz, Tahoma2D) and import the images and `.xdts` file to continue working with accurate frame exposure.

## 📁 Understanding Your Output Files

- **Image Sequence:** Individual PNG files named in order (e.g., layer_001.png, layer_002.png). These represent each frame of your animation.
- **XDTS File:** This is a small text file in the Toei Digital Exposure Sheet format. It tells compatible programs how long each frame should be shown.
  
Together, these allow you to take your Krita animation and use it directly in other software without losing timing or layer order.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Tips

- If the plugin doesn’t appear in Krita, make sure you installed it correctly and have Krita version 4.0 or later.
- Ensure you have permission to run files downloaded from the internet. Adjust your system’s security settings if needed.
- If export fails, check you selected valid layers and output folders.
- Close and restart Krita if you notice any glitches after installation.
- Visit the GitHub Issues page in this repository for reported problems or to ask questions.
